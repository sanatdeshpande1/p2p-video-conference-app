# p2p-video-conference-app using WebRTC and socket.io

This is an implementation of peer-to-peer video chat app that using webRTC and socket.io in node.js. This is a quick implementation and hence I haven't added any UI elements here. 

Note: Change the name parameter in package.json or use npm init to initialize new package for your project.
